❗ For educational purposes only - Do not nuke innocent servers!

The nuke bot is being controlled directly in the discord client.

☣️ Your IP will be blocked from accessing the discord services when nuking too many servers (If running locally)

☣️ Never use a bot created on your main account to avoid the risk of getting termed

1. Create a bot, enable member intents and copy the token

2. Fill out the required information in `config.json`. 

3. If you are using Windows, run `run.bat` to start the nuker. If you are a Linux run `bash run.sh` in the console, for MacOS do `sh run.sh`.

4. NukeCord is ready

I do not take any responsibility for termination or nuked serves.

> __**FAQ**__ ❓
> 
> **Can I use a discord account token?** No, this is not a selfbot.
> 
> **Is nuking servers against TOS?** In fact, it's not - But sending too many requests may lead to termination.
